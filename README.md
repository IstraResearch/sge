# SGE

"Sun Grid Engine" has a long history, and changed *many* ownerships (gridware -> Sun -> Oracle -> Univa -> Altair).

Sun opened the sources, Oracle closed them back. Later Univa [re-opened the sources](https://github.com/gridengine/gridengine) for a while and implemented many fixes, but closed it back circa 2013.

In response to the first source-closure some forks of the open repo were started. Notably ["Open Grid Scheduler"](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/) which is the origin from which this repo forked, which died ~2011.  A different fork, ["Son of Grid"](https://github.com/daimh/sge) seems to still be actively maintained by Michigan university.

This repo implements some fixes on top of the OpenGridScheduler fork of SGE, but it seems SonOfGrid is a more modern fork for more general needs.
